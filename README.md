# AI Engineer Career Path Portfolio Projects

This repository contains portfolio projects for the AI Engineer Career Path, demonstrating practical applications of neural network engineering, LLM operations, AI applications, and AI agent development.

## Repository Structure

### [Engineer Neural Networks](./Engineer-Neural-Networks)

**Classifying Banking Intent From Customer Queries**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI engineering workflow for an NLP classification task, comparing traditional neural networks with modern transformer-based models finetuned with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).

**Project Overview:**
Build a production-ready AI system that classifies customer banking intent from queries across 77 intent classes. This project showcases:

- **Modern AI Architectures:** Compare Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers with LoRA-finetuned RoBERTa transformers
- **Production-Ready Systems:** Implement comprehensive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) protection for sensitive financial data
- **End-to-End Pipeline:** From exploratory data analysis through model training, evaluation, and responsible AI implementation

**What You'll Build:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Explore and visualize customer query texts
   - Analyze distribution patterns across intent classes

2. **Model Development**
   - Build and train MLP classifier with text preprocessing pipelines
   - Finetune RoBERTa transformer using parameter-efficient LoRA
   - Compare traditional vs modern architecture performance

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Establish baseline metrics across 77 intent classes
   - Analyze per-class performance improvements
   - Compare training efficiency and computational requirements

**Prerequisites:**
- Python fundamentals
- Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
- Machine Learning: Classification metrics, train-test splits, evaluation
- AI/Deep Learning: Neural networks, PyTorch, Transformers (Hugging Face), LoRA
- Text preprocessing: Data cleaning, regex patterns, PII detection, hashing
